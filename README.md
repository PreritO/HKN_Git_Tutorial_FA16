# HKN_Git_Tutorial_FA16

Welcome!

This is the Git repository for the HKN GIT Seminars that
are held at CU-Boulder every semester. This specific
repo is in reference to the seminar in Fall 2016 and contains
a file called "file.txt" which is the file that the students
will be able to update throughout the seminar. Additionally, there is a powerpoint presentation that goes along with the
seminar.

If you have any further inquiries or would like to use the content for your seminar, feel free to contact
Prerit Oberai at prerit.oberai@colorado.edu with the Subject:
"HKN Git Seminar Inquiry".
